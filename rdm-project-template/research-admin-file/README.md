## `research-admin-files/`

This directory can be used to store any other content that is valuable for administering the research project that is not already documented elsewhere in the project template. This directory can be further organized into sub-directories. Commonly included contents include meeting notes, historical documents, background information, planning documents, and more. 

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is optional but highly recommended and commonly used. In the Arcus Labs, the study team manages this folder.
