## Help

Projects are version controlled and the `README` file functions as a project homepage, providing context and guidance around files and processes in your research. A well-structured README helps document how study teams manage, organize, and use files and can ease transitions between team members and over time. 

Each directory used in the project template holds a `README` file that explains its use. 

The project-level `README` should include a short project description/abstract. Additional contents may include a folder overview, important dates, a list of people with their roles and responsibilities, related files, process information, change log and version control documentation, and established naming conventions. 

Recommended practices for writing a `README` file can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/arcus-edu-libsci/Arcus%20RDM%20Resources/Arcus_RDM_READMEBestPractices.pdf).

## Admin Notes

A project-level README is required. In the Arcus Labs, the study team manages all README files. 

####  `Admin Notes` in subdirectory README Files
Information about who is responsible for each subdirectory is found in the `Admin Notes` section of the given subdirectory's README file.
