## `reports/`

Content for producing reports, papers, and websites associated with the research project. Other content appropriate for maintaining in `reports/` includes a version controlled methods section for the research project and logs for computational lab notebooks. 

We suggest you version control this directory and further organize into customized sub-directories as needed. Study teams commonly use dedicated sub-directories for figures and tables used to support final products (paper, website, etc). 

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is optional. In the Arcus Labs, this folder is managed by the study team.
