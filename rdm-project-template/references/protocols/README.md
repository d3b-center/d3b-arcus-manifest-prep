## `references/protocols/`

Contains experimental protocol metadata captured in YAML. This directory is commonly used with and recommended for bioinformatics research projects, especially those containing exome sequencing data. Protocol templates for fastq, BAM, CRAM, gVCF, VCF can be found [here](https://github.research.chop.edu/evansj/arcus-es-ingestion/tree/master/references/protocols). Protocols should be associated with their corresponding data files in the [`file_manifest.csv`](https://github.research.chop.edu/arcus/rdm-project-template/blob/master/manifests/file_manifest.csv)


## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is optional. For studies containing exome sequencing data, this sub-directory is required. In the Arcus Labs, this folder is managed by the study team.
