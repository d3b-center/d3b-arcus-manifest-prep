## `configs/`

Holds configuration files for workflows and applications. This folder can be further organized into sub-directories as needed. 

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is optional. In the Arcus Labs, the study team manages this folder. When preparing an Arcus lab for archiving, two sub-directories will be added: a folder titled lab-image (contains the tag of the Arcus lab image that the lab was using) and environments (contains the enviroment files documenting the environment for running scripts and machine learning models).
