## `data/endpoints/`

This folder contains the final results from research analysis, including files generated to support papers or grants. 

This directory can be further organized into sub-directories. Common options are to organize subdirectories by file type (bam, fastq, etc), batches arranged by date, and more.

All endpoint files should be listed in [`manifests/file_manifest.csv`](../manifests/file_manifest.csv).

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is required. In Arcus Labs, the study team manages this folder, with Arcus responsible for including all files in the inventory of the project template file manifest.
