## `data/raw/`

This directory holds authoritative source data that should never be deleted. This directory can be further organized into sub-directories as needed.

Raw data files should be listed in [`manifests/file_manifest.csv`](../manifests/file_manifest.csv).

## Admin Notes

This sub-directory is required. In Arcus Labs, Arcus will manage this folder and will deliver initial data here, whether that data is Arcus-generated, archival data delivered for secondary use, or study team-generated data brought into Arcus. 

A README for the `data/raw/` directory is required.
